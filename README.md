# eduTAP Website based on Gatby

## Updating Data

You can update data in three different locations in the repository:

- `/static/presentations`
- `/src/images`
- `/src/data`

### Presentations

Here you can add presentations (.pdf).
These can be linked in the roadmap.json file in `src/data/roadmap.json`.
You don't have to specify the path, but only the filename.

### Images

This folder contains all images used in the website.
You will most likely only need to add images in the `team` sub-folder.
Here you can add/edit images for team members. They can be either `.png` or `.jpg`.
In the `src/data/team.json` file you can link the images to the team members by specifying the relative path to the
image.
(e.g. `../images/team/your-image.png`)

### Data

The data folder contains the following files:

- `nav.json`
- `history.json`
- `roadmap.json`
- `presentations.json`
- `team.json`

You will most likely only need to edit the last three files.
In the `presentations.json` file you can add presentations to the presentations page.
In the `roadmap.json` file you can add milestones to the roadmap.
(s. Presentation section on how to add presentations to milestones).
In the `team.json` file you can add team members.
(s. Image section on how to add images for team members).

#### News

The website supports two types of news: micro news and news posts.
Both news types will be displayed on the news index page.

To add a micro news, add a new entry to the `micro-news.json` file in the `src/data` folder.
The entry should have the following fields:

```json
{
  "title": "Micro news",
  "description": "This is a micro news post",
  "date": "2022-11-24",
  "url": "https://www.example.com"
}
```

The `url` field is optional and can be used to link to an external page. 
If you don't want to link to an external page, set the `url` field to `null`.
The date must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".


If you want to add a news post, add a new markdown file to the `src/data/news-posts` folder.
Make sure to add a frontmatter to the markdown file with the following fields:

```yaml
slug: "/my-first-blog-post" # <-- must have a leading slash
date: "2022-11-24" # <-- must be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
title: "My first blog post" # <-- Will be displayed as the title of the post, so you don't have to repeat the title in the post content 
short: "This is my first blog post" # <-- short description of the post that will be displayed on the news index page
```

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

Make sure to have npm installed.
If in doubt use nvm and install the stable version.

In the repositories root directory:

First run `npm install` one time.

Then start the development server `npm run develop`.

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

Edit and save a file in `src/pages/` to see your site update in real-time!

User `npm run clean` to delete the cache and public folder. This is useful if you have problems with the development
server.

3. **Deployment to GH Pages**

Push to the master branch and the site will be deployed automatically.
