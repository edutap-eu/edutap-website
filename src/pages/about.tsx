                        Welcome to eduTAP, where "education meets the tap" ‚Äì inspired by the convenience of modern
                        smartphone interactions like "tap to pay" and "tap to open." Just as you can effortlessly tap
                        your smartphone for various transactions, eduTAP enhances the (inter-)campus experience by
                        enabling university members to use their smartphones for a multitude of campus activities. With
                        specific passes securely stored in their digital wallets, individuals can seamlessly:

                        eduTAP is committed to realizing the interoperability vision of the European Student Card,
                        establishing a cutting-edge "common identity document" (eduID) based on ISO/IEC standards and
                        dedicated service passes for education institution members. Our mission is to provide a unified
                        way to access on-campus services, all while prioritizing user privacy and complying with
                        European legal requirements. We're proud to align our efforts with G√©ant Trust and Identity
                        Services, joining the ranks of eduGAIN, eduroam, eduTEAMS, and InAcademia.

                                <strong>eduTAP-Core (Generic):</strong> This component provides the software to create
                                common identity passes and service-specific passes for issuing institutions. It connects
                                with various wallet providers, offers callback applications, and includes a Pass Issuing
                                Management Portal and a Pass Designer.

                                <strong>Central Service Directory:</strong> We manage a system for announcing services
                                within Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) to a central directory, simplifying access to
                                digital passes for these services. A REST API and micro search portals are also part of
                                this initiative.

                                and we provide support libraries and sample apps to accommodate these differences. These
                                include VAS/Smarttap libraries and ISO/IEC 18013-5 libraries for reading passes, as well
                                as apps for checking student status and course/exam check-ins.
