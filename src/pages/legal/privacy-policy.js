            <p>Our hoster collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:</p>
            <p>
                IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referer request header), date and time of the
                request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount
                of data transferred, website from which the request came and information about the browser and operating

                statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each
                page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.
